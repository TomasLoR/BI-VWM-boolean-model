totally
unfamiliar
uh
human
nature
like
change
yes

another
well
lived
united
state
country
use
metric
system
uh
lived
pound
inch
found
really
quite
easy
convert
um
secret
seeming
bother
ever
converting
inch
centimeter
pound
kilometer
right
uh
kilogram
think
hung
people
went
wait
minute
inch
two
point
fifty
four
centimeter
earth
every
going
math
right
right
right
problem
tried
convert
everything
inch
centimeter
preserving
basically
inch
expressing
centimeter
rather
saying
centimeter
width
thumbnail
whatever
know
leaving
uh
know
kilogram
weighs
much
get
used
scratch
still
convert
back
forth
inch
centimeter
perfectly
comfortable
using
either
think
real
problem
weird
conversion
see
sign
say
fifty
five
mile
per
hour
know
whatever
would
one
hundred
six
kilometer
per
hour
know
people
know
hard
take
seriously
oh
yeah
long
given
basically
read
kilometer
per
hour
say
well
look
read
mile
per
hour
one
one
must
someone
else
right
uh
know
mean
even
britain
converted
inherited
mess
uh
right
fault
well
mean
fault
point
saw
light
um
know
um
able
except
think
probably
said
well
going
start
using
thing
sort
force
people
change
since
want
course
part
european
community
everybody
else
probably
much
much
necessary
true
probably
true
america
long
history
sort
thing
way
rather
adopting
know
model
well
uh
expression
eye
past
backing
confidently
future
never
heard
one
nice
oh
metric
system
converting
think
guess
feeling
way
start
giving
weight
know
brief
transition
period
start
giving
weight
kilometer
kilometer
weight
kilogram
everything
like
uh
people
start
using
rather
people
constantly
trying
convert
remember
getting
package
something
said
one
pound
package
date
mind
presumably
something
weigh
fairly
precisely
said
one
pound
parenthesis
said
four
hundred
fifty
four
point
six
gram
right
right
near
could
tell
seeing
basically
antimetric
propaganda
anyone
would
say
well
look
either
buy
pound
something
four
hundred
sixty
four
point
six
gram
course
could
weigh
accurately
anyway
um
every
time
see
something
like
think
well
antimetric
argument
yep
well
think
could
ever
happen
quick
transition
think
would
easiest
way
human
nature
would
think
would
take
probably
two
three
year
people
could
could
completely
cut
cord
yeah
oh
oh
thinking
quick
transition
mean
know
mean
like
sweden
going
right
hand
drive
anything
know
midnight
tonight
switch
anything
switch
uh
believe
yeah
think
overnight
know
gradually
example
something
gradually
well
true
kind
discreet
transaction
yes
quantum
leap
left
right
hand
drive
know
must
taken
uh
something
done
quickly
know
external
circumstance
decided
make
sync
rest
europe
rest
continental
europe
interesting
oh
yes
yeah
yeah
know
must
tremendously
difficult
orchestrate
um
sure
think
essential
done
think
real
trick
avoid
know
little
attention
human
psychology
whereas
people
want
round
number
whole
reason
go
metric
round
number
deal
thirty
second
inch
exact
exactly
exactly
thing
best
metric
thing
poorly
represented
really
think
well
two
liter
soda
pop
bottle
saw
saw
day
drink
soda
pop
saw
two
liter
soda
pop
bottle

good
start
start
expressing
one
liter
one
kilogram
pound
come
know
odd
number
