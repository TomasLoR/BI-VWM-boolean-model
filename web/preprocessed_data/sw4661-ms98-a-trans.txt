people
turned
math
high
school
math
going
school
offer
lot
choice
taking
first
year
two
explore
choice
still
give
plenty
time
pick
suggesting
liberal
art
program
take
smattering
everything
eventually
focus
single
major
certainly
would
say
go
liberal
art
school
strong
science
program
uh
would
even
encourage
liberal
art
school
engineering
program
tend
look
like
see
student
graduating
engineering
degree
seventy
five
eighty
percent
time
spent
prearranged
technical
curriculum
moving
towards
program
bachelor
art
master
science
combined
get
general
education
guaranteed

engineering
degree
master
degree
oh
seems
like
good
compromise
