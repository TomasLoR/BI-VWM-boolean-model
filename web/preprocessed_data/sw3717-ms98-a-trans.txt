uh
lot
people
around
utah

though
oh
yeah
uh
whether

probably
area
going
tax
credit
union

level
ass
insurance
fund
higher

stick
little
niche
probably
seems
like
uh
getting
lot
bank
territory
know
fair
uh
know
fair
think
know
way
banking
uh
compacted
work
nation
bank
merged
sovran
yeah
yeah
oh
yeah
uh
know
think
think
little
competition
good
yeah
uh
lot
saw
say
thing
yeah
getting
business
lending
thing
like
yeah
credit
union
work
one
top
twenty
uh
fifteenth
largest
starting
get
really
question
whether
yeah
real

know
able
playing
level
field
whereas
bank
getting
taxed
stuff
yeah
know
corporate
tax
far
much
get
taxed
mean
know
would
would
definitely
effect
bottom
line
got
taxed
doubt
everybody
gone
think
individual
level
fine
uh
think
perceived
uh
learned
school
taxed
hundred
percent
income
people
made
hundred
thousand
dollar
know
uh
would
reduce
deficit
yeah
drop
bucket
people

guess
anything
flat
tax
anything
like
mean
talked
kind
kind
recessive
tax
poor
well
sale
tax
yeah
true
mean
national
level
guess
seems
like

uh
get
rid
lot
problem
far
loop
hole
stuff
maybe
based
two
three
different
level
eliminate
lot
exemption
stuff
uh
flat

pretty
good
idea
uh
debating

capital
gain
uh
stimulate
economy
yeah
uh
find
recall
stimulate
economy
much
uh
boot
everybody
feeling
stimulating
economy
yeah
le
thing
opposed
yeah
yeah
always
heard
poor
would
end
end
taking
worst
brunt
know
income
le
yet
taxed
rate
therefore
hurt
spending
power
know
heard
different
idea
make
uh
know
depending
income
maybe
different
level
tax
seems
like
people
would
whatever
could
hide
income
like
say
probably
would
much
anyway
happens
think
good
idea
chip
away
mean
home
mortgage
deduction
like
sacrosanct
yeah
true
take
away
people
said
go
got
one
exception

sweet
none
got
eight
percent
state
sale
