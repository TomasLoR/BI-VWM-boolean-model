sure
exact
uh
specification
texas
know
uh
capital
punishment
certain
crime
probably

guess
take
someone
else
life
automatically
giving
uh
place
seems
lot
controversy
yeah
uh
uh
tend
agree
uh
know
probably
pretty
similar
view
one
thing
understand
much
controversy
uh
know
also
believe

uh
uh
know
really
irks
see
much
effort
put
preventing
someone
put
death
state
callously
usually

without
even
thinking
without
concern
uh
know
end
somebody
else
life
lot
case
several
people
life
true
guess
well
probably
two
three
different
type
view
far
controversy
go
see
life
taken
accident
uh
know
would
call
premeditated
guess
primarily
accident
uh
may
case
death
penalty
called
lean
towards
premeditated
uh
oh
kind
habitual
habit
uh
tendency
people
uh
may
get
guess
really
problem
yeah
kind
way
feel
got
guy
trial
jail
know
basically
three
time
loser
twelfth
time
know
go
kill
somebody
going
reformed
going
get
better
know
going
going
get
better
thing
know
lot
people
opinion
know
capital
punishment
give
life
jail
know
could
go
along
could
assured
would
natural
life
jail
parole
ten
twelve
year

uh
deterrent
think
chance
getting
death
penalty
cre
uh
committing

really
pretty
slim
right
probably
spend
uh
lot
time
