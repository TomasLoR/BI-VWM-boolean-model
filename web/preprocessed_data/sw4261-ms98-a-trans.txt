served
jury
duty
ironic
summons
thirtieth
monday
next
little
authoritative
um
either
recently
advent
court
tv
watched
little
bit
um
uh
would
probably
year
ago
getting
little
interested
court
procedure
um
yeah
would
think
um
sentencing
would
kind
thing
expert
system
would
ideal
know
whole
bunch
evidence
supposed
weighed
nice
uniform
sentencing
particular
thing
would
um
seem
like
perfect
solution
suppose
would
really
subject
abuse
well
well
uh
guess
could
agree
extent
think
largely
would
uniform
think
uh
opposed
real
mixture
jury
different
location
different
know
idea
yeah
much
variation
sentencing
like
guy
recently
um
guy
convicted
volunteered
castrated
guess
area
uh
yeah
uh
think
yeah
houston
hearing
yeah
gone
um
surgeon
could
found
perform
job
judge
went
withdrew
whole
idea
something
like
yeah
plus
getting
lot
uh
uh
criticism
guess
different
group
know
inhumane
know
sort
thing
yeah
one
thing
would
certainly
like
see
um
criminal
sentenced
sort
uh
mean
paying
um
incarceration
think
reasonable
side
uh
justice
system
pay
pay
way
life
yeah
cost
real
high
guess
uh
keeping
someone
prison
going
trial
procedure
whole
whole
work
uh
yeah
absolutely
come
tax
money
uh
lot
case
uh
uh
person
tried
sometimes
know
mean
uh
repay
court
victim
prison
uh
keep
really
perform
sort
work
currently
done
prison
yeah
would
think
lot
lot
production
could
could
done
um
know
people
like
whether
totally
unskilled
yeah
yeah
need
make
adjustment
um
uh
question
guess
addressed
uh
whether
uh
verdict
require
unanimous
uh
uh
decision
tough
one
seem
group
hard
time
agreeing
say
democracy
flaw
democracy
nobody
um
agree
anything
hard
get
everybody
agree
something
saying
remember
yeah
yeah
know
seems
like
um
everything
stacked
favor
criminal
shame
majority
would
vote
uh
guilty
one
dissenting
vote
could
jeopardize
whole
uh
whole
process
whole
whole
verdict
yeah
really
really
good
point
seems
like
uh
come
sort
majority
maybe
um
uh
maybe
two
third
three
quarter
majority
something
hard
get
every
single
person
agree
anything
like
say
know
um
certain
percentage
agrees
well
right
unanimous
decision
hung
jury
uh
asked
stay
try
come
unanimous
verdict
eventually
uh
uh
unanimous
even
one
vote
sometimes
think
either
thrown
go
retrial
hum
um
even
one
person
holding
convinced
uh
vote
guilty
time
expense
yeah
mean
really
really
really
really
lot
cost
uh
bring
trial
interesting
yeah
seems
lot
problem
uh
criminal
justice
system
america
today
certainly
one
answer
yeah
need
revising
heard
little
unrelated
guess
heard
uh
day
said
someone
convicted
put
death
row
million
cost
keep
person
execute
person
time
know
usually
take
year
hum
unbelievably
appeal
process
go
yeah
automatic
long
way
least
yeah
uh
amazing
talking
million
dollar
per
