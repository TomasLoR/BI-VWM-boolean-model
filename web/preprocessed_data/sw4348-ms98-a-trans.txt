kind
obsolete
question
point
since
soviet
union
anymore
right
mean
yeah
first
think
agree
former
soviet
union
former
right
right
say
soon
former
uh
commonwealth
independent
state
instead
true
one
well
personally
still
view
threat
long
got
nuclear
weapon
weapon
hit
consider
much
threat
anymore
term
using
already
starting
see
demonstrated
cash
starved
country
know
thing
equal
commodity
sold
people
worry
lot
soviet
union
true
would
agree
also
know
mean
already
case
uh
guy
selling
uranium
trying
sell
uranium
open
market
part
true
also
uh
problem
know
scientist
know
need
money
also
rich
yeah
fact
hearing
suggestion
set
fund
get
alternative
area
research
reasonable
amount
pay
go
libya
somewhere
like
sure
mean
yeah
think
still
lot
threat
sure
like
said
kind
obsolete
soviet
union
threatening
though
right
think
actually
know
except
fact
happen
due
west
got
fallout
cloud
think
probability
going
involved
first
strike
anything
fairly
fairly
high
know
certainly
lot
people
arguing
right
nuclear
weapon
also
concern
sovereign
uh
republic
lot
islamic
nuclear
weapon
based
break
instance
decide
align
iran
iraq
suddenly
difficult
position
sure
another
another
problem
would
worry
somewhat
uh
would
say
using
nuclear
weapon
know
another
area
um
since
since
know
disagreement
different
commonwealth
yeah
uh
know
different
etiology
also
use
would
audit
detection
type
system
mean
chance
accident
case
also
top
fallout
factor
right
course
thing
got
arguing
nuclear
sub
whole
question
whether
one
uh
sub
driver
going
decide
become
free
lance
oh
want
want
go
russia
going
uh
know
sell
highest
bidder
something
right
absolutely
yeah
whole
thing
scary
thing
destabulation
destabilization
destabilization
right
let
let
choke
one
uh
uh
know
soviet
union
uh
big
concern
scary
thing
right
know
possible
scenario
course
going
hard
entire
area
instance
see
russia
especially
lot
hard
liner
coming
back
economic
reform
working
could
find
right
back
position
sure
thing
think
got
going
large
stick
form
economic
aid
technological
aid
lot
republic
seem
interested
getting
aid
nuclear
weapon
true
um
know
granted
know
cold
war
scary
thing
least
non
commodity
yeah
know
knew
know
knew
yeah
say
think
overall
overall
thing
instead
unstability
area
actually
stable
stable
think
inherently
chance
going
involved
anything
fairly
low
think
none
foolish
enough
want
attack
united
state
well
especially
divided
bigger
anymore
yeah
mean
looking
help
uh
looking
know
uh
invasion
point
yeah
think
true
uh
know
even
even
one
necessarily
looking
help
know
getting
massive
amount
help
wanting
germany
third
world
country
would
would
probably
also
keep
know
blatant
uh
uh
know
act
war
uh
picture
know
think
going
think
looking
uh
potential
anything
large
scale
um
know
think
certainly
people
government
would
like
think
still
threat
um
know
listening
mpr
yesterday
talk
sea
hawk
submarine
know
saying
know
wait
minute
want
build
like
two
three
multibillion
dollar
submarine
know
reason
keep
gratin
connecticut
alive
yeah
think
people
government
perceive
would
whose
job
make
sure
still
perceive
threat
may
one
anymore
sure
