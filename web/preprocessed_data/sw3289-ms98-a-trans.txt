uh
yeah
interesting
point
enthusiast
jury
particularly
think
especially
civil
case
doubt
doubt
effectiveness
thought
term
cost
point
view
providing
jury
think
may
major
country
today
still
us
jury
civil
trial
know
one
never
heard
may
right
wish
would
know
never
heard
pretty
sure
britain
uh
given
jury
civil
case
mean
elected
official
supposedly
unbiased
supposed
head
shoulder
make
decision
well
probably
judge
would
people
decision
whether
use
jury
decision
decision
whether
far
civil
concerned
mean
think
would
better
judge
trained
professional
deciding
thing
true
um
know
constitutional
way
change
constitution
probably
right
still
far
concerned
think
wrong
use
jury
civil
matter
talk
criminal
matter
uh
got
problem
one
know
talking
uh
person
fit
society
followed
rule
society
got
problem
using
peer
quote
quote
helping
make
decision
although
would
problem
qualifies
uh
jury
think
manipulative
rule
use
say
rich
famous
jury
poor
dreg
know
make
sense
uh
think
guess
different
state
different
rule
well
amount
rich
got
money
really
high
society
somehow
another
going
come
one
excuse
judge
going
say
yeah
excused
poor
old
uh
blue
collar
worker
know
uh
trying
eke
living
uh
work
eight
five
know
reason
going
find
excuse
get
typically
find
jury
made
dumbest
people
rather
smarter
people
initially
come
selected
panel
uh
okay
certainly
side
right
pick
criterion
want
want
judge
jury
uh
veto
lot
suspect
uh
well
see
likely
get
way
although
vary
true
um
mean
guess
traditionally
jury
supposed
finding
fact
opposed
finding
law
deciding
also
make
decision
long
person
serve
well
varies
state
locality
whether
okay
jury
even
know
hell
even
talking
uh
little
basis
comparison
get
someone
say
okay
person
convicted
thirty
year
two
year
later
probation
jury
know
state
texas
think
allowed
uh
jury
allowed
told
soon
person
would
probation
thing
determine
long
put
jail
knowing
rest
rule
think
unfair
well
guess
feel
much
comfortable
judge
either
