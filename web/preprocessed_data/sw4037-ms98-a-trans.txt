yeah
death
penalty
exercised
often
believe
even
remember
last
execution
actually
uh
personally
favor
capital
punishment
know
lot
lot
problem
uh
seems
crime
heinous
person
uh
feel
deserve
live
deserve
tax
payer
spend
however
many
thousand
dollar
cost
year
keep
prison
life
right
uh
know
lot
problem
like
well
say
okay
declare
someone
put
death
row
execute
well
ten
late
year
later
find
really
life
wasted

dallas
uh
know
seen
uh
seen
case
news
know
uh
right
person
murdered
person
back
street
commits
another
murder

think
maybe
good
solution
capital
punishment
might
uh
reserve
solely
uh
repeat
offender
crime
like
uh
murder
thought
never
really
seems
pretty
sensible
yeah
uh

completely
man
convicted
two
murder
uh
know
pretty
good
chance
something
wrong
right
uh
also
uh
tell
liberal
turned
uh
toward
whatever
side
kind
chosen
uh
believe
uh
right
yeah
big
time
drug
importer
like
uh

choice
people
uh
really
kind
uh
uh
jail
sentence
another
chance
uh
create
another
power
structure
yeah

figure
cost
fifty
thousand
dollar
taxpayer
dollar
year
keep
someone
alive
jail
going
life
never
going
rehabilitated

believe
prison
system
today
much
towards
rehabilitation
begin
paying
tax
know
twenty
percent
check
whatever
right
keep
somebody
alive
mind
first
place
never
going

think
uh
capital
capital
punishment
uh
uh
sentenced

kind
playing
god
never

uh
really
agree
uh
death
penalty
people
like
