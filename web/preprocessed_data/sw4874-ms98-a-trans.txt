well
soviet
union
uh
really
called
commonwealth
independent
state
um
mess
um
uh
think
one
biggest
thing
worry
uh
control
nuclear
arm
especially
ukraine
russia
yeah
main
concern
right
first
point
current
government
situation
see
threat
moment
however
current
state
central
government
um
tenuous
would
take
much
uh
kind
fascist
revival
within
uh
russia
republic
real
clear
foreign
policy
problem
threat
number
nuclear
weapon
seem
lost
ability
control
going
country
right
country
many
nuclear
weapon
certainly
threat
perhaps
second
yeah
know
suppose
say
rational
uh
person
would
would
would
launch
uh
nuclear
weapon
um
guess
would
necessarily
hold
uh
radical
government
temporary
take
even
well
work
international
radio
um
uh
one
group
working
radio
eurovan
armenia
know
sense
would
think
know
american
westerner
would
make
sense
real
great
threat
people
nut
listen
armenian
say
neighbor
azerbaijani
launch
second
access
weapon
right
great
deal
religious
hatred
part
world
stuff
go
back
day
christ
mean
yeah
yeah
two
hundred
year
fifty
year
uh
problem
go
back
century
amount
hatred
mean
accusation
using
chemical
weapon
side
yes
yeah
republican
strife
amongst
various
um
former
part
soviet
union
think
could
regional
use
nuclear
weapon
think
see
threat
anymore
right
guess
agree
um
um
concern
time
go
could
become
economic
threat
um
think
happen
go
asian
right
type
uh
introduction
business
world
beginning
cheap
labor
uh
know
would
say
thirty
year
thing
stay
way
thing
could
become
another
korea
malaysia
thailand
type
source
cheap
labor
american
product
could
built
uh
think
headed
right
well
think
uh
qualitative
difference
uh
russia
much
soviet
union
still
lot
natural
resource
country
mentioned
never
uh
know
commonwealth
state
could
could
easily
know
leapfrog
uh
know
stepping
stone
path
uh
laid
southeast
asian
country
well
huge
oil
reserve
problem
ability
exploit
point
right
could
become
major
source
oil
well
timber
um
product
agriculture
could
become
important
using
modern
farming
technique
ukraine
suspect
form
sort
economic
union
said
done
think
think
yeah
yeah
yeah
still
going
uh
know
settling
period
know
sure
want
leader
sure
want
know
uh
relationship
state
shape
agree
know
need
another
couple
year
let
uh
settle
uh
start
cooperating
well
certainly
hope
wish
would
incorporate
sort
marshall
plan
think
one
problem
country
dealing
enough
right
chance
thing
getting
control
another
fascist
type
regime
rising
quite
good
um
anyone
point
give
food
security
make
know
feel
pride
could
become
major
threat
especially
republic
striving
become
independent
central
moscow
kind
administration
um
get
tush
spend
effort
money
fund
trying
get
thing
back
ground
think
