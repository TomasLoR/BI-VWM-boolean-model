interesting
uh
point
sentencing
judge
alone
away
jury
know
would
willing
accept
um
abuse
would
come
along
would
relatively
easy
get
bad
decision
even
get
judge
standpoint
bribery
yeah
even
year
bench
becomes
uh
touch
uh
population
see
bad
side
life
much
end
making
bad
decision
however
complexity
uh
case
spend
time
educating
jury
point
make
decision
would
take
judge
made
decision
especially
purely
um
noncriminal
uh
litigation
type
uh
whatever
want
call
term
civil
uh
suit
even
corporate
uh
law
individual
involved
solved
without
jury
uh
choose
go
yeah
um
think
aspect
unanimous
jury
jury
must
six
twelve
uh
agree
topic
final
verdict
final
yeah
uh
tough
situation
mean
know
mean
sometimes
feel
like
maybe
kind
pressured
really
know
know
uh
people
go
home
jury
duty
always
like
know
kind
whining
seems
like
people
really
know
subject
uh
know
mean
guess
people
would
better
like
know
majority
guess
smaller
number
like
six
twelve
usually
um
guess
unanimous
uh
yeah
kind
agree
okay
thing
thinking
far
one
holdout
say
twelve
yeah
reasonable
could
assume
must
reason
person
holding
obviously
eleven
five
convince
person
uh
vote
one
way
maybe
worth
extra
little
going
farthest
uh
safeguard
done
uh
yeah
trying
get
wrong
decision
yeah
see
uh
system
stand
think
jury
done
away
judge
could
render
decision
much
quicker
uh
would
would
feed
people
court
know
would
put
got
court
uh
yeah
think
rate
processing
uh
reached
rate
housing
anyway
keep
keep
normal
upset
system
much
yeah
yeah
heard
um
true
lawyer
take
case
court
call
um
frivolous
still
frivolous
law
probably
yeah
would
imagine
judge
could
throw
yeah
think
would
fine
lawyer
would
imagine
left
judge
would
assume
could
consider
contempt
court
uh
anything
wanted
whatever
limit
contempt
court
oh
