um
guess
supposed
switching
metric
system
uh
sense
going
happen
anytime
soon
yeah
think

acoustic
metric
stuff
acoustic
acoustic
ah
yeah
everything
metric
go

something
confusing
understand
much
think
get

policy
policy
long
time
nothing
ever
happens
uh
suppose
thing
thing
well
happen
slowly
simply
taught
school
extent
happening
new
generation
come
used
yeah
lot
industry
metric
stuff
international
trade
yeah
guess
guess
easier
switch
back
forth
used
uh
uh
computer
coming
everything
yeah
think
switching
back
forth
big
deal
think
people
need
understand
like
meter
instead
many
foot
meter
something
get
used
using
term
someone
say
kilogram
one
know
everyone
want
want
conversion
put
recognizing
concept
hold
mind
yeah
um
see
change
quickly
mean
kind
society
uh
something
posed
upon
uh
government
yeah
one
seems
adopting
metric
system
one
uh
one
want
seems
like
uh
public
conservative
way
refusing
change
measurement
system
uh
money
dollar
coin
anything
like
yeah
obviously
make
sense
practically
alone
world
using
old
system
yeah
know
pretty
tough
get
everything
confused
though
think
two
system
worse
one
though
know
lot
problem
thing
half
english
half
metric
make
mistake
conversion
would
problem
think
get
one
even
prefer
metric
even
english
least
one
well
mean
unfortunately
think
people
like
relatively
rare
rare
coming
problem
everyday
yeah
yeah
think
average
guy
driving
highway
want
know
many
mile
destination
uh
mean
thing

nist
campus
speed
limit
twenty
five
mile
per

forty
kilometer
per
hour
yeah
uh
adopted
widely
yeah
ohio
one
sign
kind
funny
say

go
step
remove
english
sign
yeah
would
force
everybody
use
quit
selling
tape
measure
inch
uh
know
mean
highway

limit
um
eighty
eighty
five
whatever
would
appropriate
number
yeah
guess
hundred
sixty
two
hundred
car
going
sixty
two
yeah
would
like
uh

car
going
fifty
five
uh
suddenly
even
worse
problem
speeding
yeah
bunch
people
trying
ninety
know
school
emphasize
metric
system
yeah
engineering
pretty
much
meant
meant
like
elementary
school
oh
elementary
school
know
would
think
remember
way
back
like
conversion
never
actually
went
