think
immigration
problem
right
well
hard
say
certainly
uh
discussion
uh
people
trying
come
haiti
uh
government
wanting
send
back
clear
evidence
uh
political
uh
repression
uh
country
set
long
uh
people
place
uh
giving
opportunity
new
start
uh
back
day
lot
lot
land
lot
opportunity
uh
seem
available
well
think
think
still
lot
land
particularly
desirable
land
yeah
think
think
know
plain
never
completely
settled
true
uh
know
uh
know
sure
sure
know
plenty
room
room
immigrant
north
south
dakota
think
immigrant
want
move
north
south
dakota
uh
true
uh
think
fact
though
standard
uh
equitable
policy
place
causing
lot
trouble
uh
essentially
essentially
immigration
lottery
month
back
yeah
hearing
seemed
like
silliest
thing
would
ever
heard
know
immigrate
totally
without
merit
um
know
get
lucky
number
right
one
thing
uh
everyone
arm
uh
certain
preference
given
uh
people
coming
ireland
decision
like
made
uh
oh
enough
irish
country
seems
fairly
strange
uh
uh
either
know
oh
feel
wrong
keeping
irish
whatever
understand
working
sure
people
running
understand
either
probably
agree
well
think
could
make
better
hard
question
always
seems
hard
question
know
lot
short
either
uh
allowing
immigration
whatsoever
opening
flood
gate
think
middle
ground
going
uh
going
uh
people
complaining
discrimination
uh
problem
like
uh
interesting
see
uh
current
administration
welcome
people
one
country
people
battling
get
haiti
uh
rounded
thrown
military
base
shipped
back
earliest
possible
moment
uh
given
fact
uh
democracy
overthrown
haiti
uh
contradictory
policy
supporting
democracy
throughout
world
want
turn
around
send
back
like
uh
government
current
government
overthrew
democracy
seems
know
seems
almost
absurd
year
ago
um
uh
know
would
welcome
uh
refugee
nicaragua
political
reason
know
el
salvador
right
could
fleeing
political
reason
know
friend
government
right
right
think
maybe
selectivity
bigger
problem
problem
immigration
selective
like
fairly
visible
people
realize
uh
oh
yes
let
people
uh
like
government
uh
odd
situation
course
touched
happens
people
visible
mean
support
come
country
without
contact
uh
skill
know
really
marketable
country
right
know
know
yeah
see
especially
hard
