well
stephanie
position
gun
control
well
scale
one
ten
uh
ten
kind
legislation
zero
uh

six
seven
um
feel
like
total
ban
gun
going
put
gun
hand
criminal
um
lived
massachusetts
two
year
total
ban
gun
saw
stop
crime
state
handgun
rifle
kind
firearm
really
yeah
uh
mandatory
jail
sentence
caught
um
firearm
also
think
fine
help
crime
better
worse
mean
huh
say

worse
certainly
get
better
usually
trying
think
guess

tend
towards
like

mean
definitely
character
search
seven
day
holding
period
thing
along
nature
uh
know
able
go
buy
one
know
right
shelf
yeah
agree
think
law
law
buy
gun
way
lax
think
think
exactly
think

control
would
good
yeah
uh
know
trying
think
many
time
make
statement
kind
exam
little
bit
know
statement
absoluteness
necessarily
true
uh
gun
hand
criminal
many
time
guess
never
heard
robbery
foiled
spoiled
person
robbed
gun
um
maybe

sure
know
think
ever
hearing
news
whatnot
hearing
knowing
anybody
robbed
good
thing
gun
thwarted
robbery
attempt
yeah
really
sure
personally
gun

think
probably
ever

like
know
handle
one
think
good

think
everybody
learn
handle
one
um
never
know
