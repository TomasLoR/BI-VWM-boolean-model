uh
interest
debt
interest

completely
little
mystified

um
large
extent

one
think
sure
largest
know
large
segment
national
debt
um
know
thing
like
saving
bond
government
obligation
okay
private
individual
government
instrument
sort
well
private

lot
public
institution
holding
money
well

um
foreign
company
foreign
person
holding
okay
nongovernmental
entity
yeah
nongovernmental
okay
holding
bond
whatever
yeah

treasury
certificate
saving
bond
whatever
okay
yeah
uh
mean
well
mean
done
point
increase
amount
sometime
eventually
go
mean
imagine
servicing
debt
really
making
progress
right
right
well
actually
uh
know
also
looking
form
borrowing
borrowing
eighteen
percent
amount
whatever
spending
every
year
increasing
debt
amount
equal
eighteen
percent
annual
budget
yeah
borrowing
eighteen
percent
fourteen
percent
paying
going
pay
eighteen
uh
debt
extent
borrowing
money
pay
know
fourteen
percent
borrowing
go
directly
paying
debt
increasing
yeah
know
net
net
borrowing
four
percent
year
borrowing
top
fourteen
percent
go
pay
interest
debt
right
uh
question
mean
country
distinctly
american
phenomenon
know
know
uh
country
work
deficit
understand
recent
within
maybe
last
fifty
year
know
except
wartime
peacetime
debt
well
guess
fifty
year
would
pretty
much
jive
last
big
wartime
debt
yeah
seemed
like
good
idea
stop
yeah
think
look
uh
government
spending
curve
um
know
curve
always
went
around
wartime
dropped
back
world
war
two
never
dropped
back
world
war
two
uh
korea
think
never
dropped
back
think
uh
know
charge
would
part
would
change
fix
problem
well
know
definitely
one
thing
say
hey
year
year
balanced
budget
least
would
additional
uh
eighteen
percent
yeah
yeah
know
know
maybe
raise
tax
year
debt
get
paid
say
know
unless
tremendously
bad
circumstance
like
war
something
running
deficit
economy
know
mean
look
individual
level
borrow
eighteen
percent
spending
every
year
year
year
would
quickly
get
trouble
creditor
well
seem
like
uh
quality
bond
united
state
sell
would
eventually
downgraded
um
yeah
well
know
post
wartime
germany
kept
printing
money
know
became
worthless
one
danger
know
large
chunk
money
pay
tax
year
shocking
apparently
one
willing
oh
one
time
end
congress
seems
