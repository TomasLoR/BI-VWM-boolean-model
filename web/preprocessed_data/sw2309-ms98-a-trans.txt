correct
long
take
something
get
jury
get
trial
true
know
pure
volume
number
uh
sometimes
think
jury
ignorant
fact
law
thing
determined
easily
swayed
emotion
yeah
think
true
hence
possible
error
see
ironside
tv
show
yeah
would
prefer
trial
judge
think
certain
thing
uh
jury
determine
far
uh
guilty
guilty
far
affixing
affixing
affixing
punishment
fine
thing
nature

miss
best
evidence
make
leave
right
judge

uh
kind
difficult
guess
whole
system
set
rather
let
uh
guilty
people
go
free
put
innocent
person
jail
right
although
