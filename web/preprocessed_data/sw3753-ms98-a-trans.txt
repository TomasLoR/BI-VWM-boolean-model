know
space
program
well
actually
point
understanding
space
program
little
limited
side
um
think
keep
way
purposely
yeah
well
extent
understandable
yeah
going
take
uh
think
going
take
long
time
uh
get
space
colony
yeah
uh
remember
uh
six
five
six
year
ago
showed
uh
one
scientific
channel
know
discovery
one
old
one
yeah
professor
uh
building
like
kind
like
space
station
supposed
people
know
uh
experimental
stage
yeah
supposed
ten
mile
long
oh
supposed
colony
research
lab
right
right
well
going
research
scientist
going
build
make
bigger
bigger
yeah
initial
stage
supposed
ten
mile
long
mean
huge
guess
space
yeah
like
central
unit
everything
else
kind
rotating
um
like
one
big
long
thing
uh
anything
circular
seen
circular
pattern
uh
know
uh
know
far
along
went
circular
pattern
yeah
yeah
uh
like
say
long
time
ago
uh
one
big
long
one
planned
thought
going
uh
regenerate
air
plant
stuff
oh
okay
thought
thought
thought
thing
really
really
expensive
yeah
got
think
five
six
year
said
know
nineteen
ninety
seven
nineteen
ninety
eight
would
actually
able
uh
start
launching
thing
yeah
would
take
several
project
go
add
piece
piece
yeah
modular
like
send
small
section
would
liveable
couple
people
send
another
section
bolt
right
got
big
enough
would
send
people
got
established
got
system
working
yeah
yeah
well
sort
thing
could
work
um
yeah
pretty
fascinating
indication
going
uh
gravity
pretty
gravity
free
environment
uh
shown
shown
like
sort
uh
simulation
would
showed
people
floating
around
uh
going
let
bob
around
hm
yeah
point
think
kind
uh
know
gravity
control
whatsoever
started
figuring
lately
gravity
form
make
whole
lot
easier
stay
long
period
hm
uh
heard
little
bit
stuff
thing
found
one
half
year
stay
soviet
cosmonaut
spent
space
problem
digestive
tract
problem
uh
uh
minor
circulatory
uh
little
problem
could
eventually
become
pretty
big
problem
people
people
problem
start
really
noticed
yet
hm
yeah
see
oh
could
generate
big
problem
um
hm
uh
people
definitely
look
kind
stuff
like
talking
space
station
going
put
spend
money
uh
yeah
lot
um
design
space
station
circular
get
spinning
centrifugal
force
come
close
enough
uh
uh
simulating
gravity
little
problem
uh
uh
gravityless
uh
side
effect
hm
know
know
saw
two
thousand
one
uh
double
wheel
arrangement
yeah
right
right
right
uh
one
popular
theory
hm
also
got
long
central
cylinder
kind
like
like
cross
connection
tube
lot
pod
sticking
central
core
kind
like
big
pine
cone
like
deal
hm
bottle
brush
almost
pod
rotating
enough
hm
hm
rotation
speed
centrifugal
force
pretty
much
one
uh
equal
earth
gravity
pretty
neat
hm
would
would
mean
make
sense
know
never
thought
ever
see
uh
epcot
center
uh
epcot
center
uh
think
display
show
bunch
uh
future
space
pod
life
would
like
space
yeah
pretty
neat
still
think
long
way
away
though
well
actually
need
put
little
much
money
going
would
whole
lot
better
spent
local
problem
yeah
yeah
um
health
care
uh
law
enforcement
uh
yeah
tell
know
expensive
oh
yeah
mean
space
program
know
uh
work
uh
satellite
telecommunication
business
putting
satellite
ridiculous
expensive
thing
unmanned
bunch
electronics
shoot
space
know
uh
bulk
probably
even
pressurized
uh
