hi
well
think
well
providing
universal
health
care
insurance
whole
country
pretty
big
task
uh
personally
approve
two
reason
number
one
think
uh
federal
government
problem
deficit
right
administer
would
uh
get
debt
ever
get
number
two
think
quality
health
care
would
go
competition
would
would
dried
really
one
would
would
answer
government
big
bureaucratic
bureaucratic
mess
uh
seen
done
country
think
uh
think
head
direction
although
problem
right
agree
exist
health
care
insurance
everyone
skyrocketing
become
point
basically
one
afford
anymore
feel
whole
whole
ordeal
well
agree
big
task
think
think
move
towards
kind
national
health
care
plan
least
long
term
kind
goal
know
possibly
know
starting
regulation
health
insurance
sort
thing
think
ultimately
would
good
idea
um
completely
socialized
medical
system
country
maybe
something
halfway
okay
um
seems
um
health
insurance
cost
sky
rocketing
well
fast
national
deficit
oh
yes
perhaps
vicious
cycle
course
think
yeah
saying
though
instead
national
government
government
administer
giving
health
insurance
every
man
woman
child
throughout
whole
company
see
regulating
high
cost
uh
people
forced
pay
right
correct
think
um
well
um
well
would
exclude
possibility
government
actually
administrating
ultimately
think
would
necessarily
bad
idea
um
well
cost
right
think
government
uh
would
require
pay
uh
tax
income
people
afford
tax
middle
income
upper
income
paying
cash
tax
pay
health
insurance
everyone
whereas
right
public
right
get
health
insurance
provide
health
insurance
well
middle
upper
class
paying
share
health
care
whole
country
people
afford
health
insurance
people
health
insurance
know
get
medical
care
anyway
least
emergency
somebody
wind
paying
basically
people
paying
people
buying
health
insurance
see
anything
situation
would
get
worse
way
might
get
better
think
might
get
better
huh
kind
disagree
reason
uh
know
guess
fear
national
government
also
bureaucratic
rule
would
take
administer
um
health
insurance
company
right
pretty
much
regulate
pretty
picky
uh
allow
case
might
throw
business
whereas
federal
government
took
everything
would
care
never
go
business
people
would
still
pay
tax
money
would
come
somewhere
would
see
feel
cost
would
increase
dramatically
also
sense
care
attitude
doctor
professional
within
medical
uh
field
would
would
diminish
um
yeah
well
think
